Remember to replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' in get_weather.php with your actual API key from OpenWeatherMap.

This code sets up the basic structure of the weather application. It includes an HTML file with input fields for location, a button to fetch weather data, and a container to display the weather information. JavaScript code handles the AJAX request to get_weather.php and updates the UI with the retrieved data. The PHP script fetches the weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and returns it as a response.

Make sure to obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap by signing up on their website and replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual key in the PHP file.

Remember to test the application on a web server that supports PHP to see the weather data displayed based on the user's input.
